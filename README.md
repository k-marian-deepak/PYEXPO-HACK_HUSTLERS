## Overview

### **Overview**  

This project aims to optimize traffic signal timings using **Deep Learning** to improve traffic flow at junctions. By dynamically adjusting green light durations based on real-time congestion levels, busier lanes receive additional time to clear traffic efficiently. The system continuously updates signal timings for all lanes to maintain smooth movement and reduce delays.  

Additionally, an automated traffic violation detection mechanism is implemented to identify rule violations, such as riding without a helmet. Upon detection, the system notifies traffic authorities, ensuring better enforcement of road safety regulations.
